# 👋 Hi there, I'm Ankesh Kushwaha

![Profile Views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=Ankesh-Kushwaha&style=flat-square)

**About Me**
I'm a passionate **Full-Stack MERN Developer** with a strong foundation in **Data Structures & Algorithms** and a hunger for continuous growth. I thrive at the intersection of functionality and efficiency — building robust web applications while writing clean, scalable code.

Currently, I’m diving deeper into the world of **DevOps**, exploring tools and practices to streamline development and deployment pipelines. In the coming months, I plan to delve into **System Design** to better architect scalable, high-performance applications.

I'm also deeply motivated to contribute to **open-source projects** — not just to grow as a developer, but to be a part of something larger that serves the community and drives positive change in the tech ecosystem.

> 🚀 On a mission to build, learn, share, and give back to society through code.
